<H2>An Optimizing Hybrid LZ77 RLE Data Compression Program, aka</H2>

<H2>Improving Compression Ratio for Low-Resource Decompression</H2>

Short:<BR>
Pucrunch is a Hybrid LZ77 and RLE compressor, uses an Elias Gamma Code for
lengths, mixture of Gamma Code and linear for LZ77 offset, and ranked RLE
bytes indexed by the same Gamma Code. Uses no extra memory in decompression.

<H2>Introduction</H2>

Since I started writing demos for the C64 in 1989 I have always wanted to
program a compression program. I had a lot of ideas but never had the time,
urge or the necessary knowledge or patience to create one. In retrospect,
most of the ideas I had then were simply bogus ("magic function theory" as
Mark Nelson nicely puts it). But years passed, I gathered more knowledge and
finally got an irresistible urge to finally realize my dream.
 <P>
The nice thing about the delay is that I don't need to write the actual
compression program to run on a C64 anymore. I can write it in portable
ANSI-C code and just program it to create files that would uncompress
themselves when run on a C64. Running the compression program outside of
the target system provides at least the following advantages.

<UL>
<LI> I can use portable ANSI-C code. The compression program can be
	compiled to run on a Unix box, Amiga, PC etc. And I have
	all the tools to debug the program and gather profiling
	information to see why it is so slow :-)
<LI> The program runs much faster than on C64. If it is still slow,
	there is always multitasking to allow me to do something else
	while I'm compressing a file.
<LI> There is 'enough' memory available. I can use all the memory I
	possibly need and use every trick possible to increase the
	compression ratio as long as the decompression remains possible
	and feasible on a C64.
<LI> Large files can be compressed as easily as shorter files. Most C64
        compressors can't handle files larger than around 52-54 kilobytes
	(210-220 disk blocks).
<LI> Cross-development is easier because you don't have to transfer a file
	into C64 just to compress it.
<LI> It is now possible to use the same program to handle VIC20 and C16/+4
	files also. It hasn't been possible to compress VIC20 files at all.
	At least I don't know any other VIC20 compressor around.

<H4>Memory Refresh and Terms for Compression</H4>

<DL>
<DT> Statistical compression
<DD>	Uses the uneven probability distribution of the source symbols to
	shorten the average code length. Huffman code and arithmetic code
	belong to this group. By giving a short code to symbols occurring
	most often, the number ot bits needed to represent the symbols
	decreases. Think of the Morse code for example: the characters you
	need more often have shorter codes and it takes less time to send
	the message.
 <P>
<DT> Dictionary compression
<DD>	Replaces repeating strings in the source with shorter
	representations. These may be indices to an actual dictionary
	(Lempel-Ziv 78) or pointers to previous occurrances (Lempel-Ziv 77).
	As long as it takes fewer bits to represent the reference than the
	string itself, we get compression. LZ78 is a lot like the way BASIC
	substitutes tokens for keywords: one-byte tokens expand to whole
	words like PRINT#. LZ77 replaces repeated strings with
	(length,offset) pairs, thus the string <TT>VICIICI</TT> can be
	encoded as <TT>VICI(3,3)</TT> -- the repeated occurrance of the
	string <TT>ICI</TT> is replaced by a reference.
 <P>
<DT> Run-length encoding
<DD>	Replaces repeating symbols with a single occurrance of the symbol
	and a repeat count. For example assembly compilers have a
	<TT>.zero</TT> keyword or equivalent to fill a number of bytes
	with zero without needing to list them all in the source code.
 <P>
<DT> Variable-length code
<DD>	Any code where the length of the code is not explicitly known but
	changes depending on the bit values. A some kind of end marker or
	length count must be provided to make a code a prefix code
	(uniquely decodable). For ASCII (or Latin-1) text you know you get
	the next letter by reading a full byte from the input.
	A variable-length code requires you to read part of the data to know
	how many bits to read next.
 <P>
<DT> Universal codes
<DD>	Universal codes are used to encode integer numbers without the need
	to know the maximum value. Smaller integer values usually get
	shorter codes. Different universal codes are optimal for different
	distributions of the values. Universal codes include Elias Gamma and
	Delta codes, Fibonacci code, and Golomb and Rice codes.
 <P>
<DT> Lossless compression
<DD>	Lossless compression algorithms are able to exactly reproduce the
	original contents unlike lossy compression, which omits details
	that are not important or perceivable by human sensory system.
	This article only talks about lossless compression.
 <P>

 <P>
My goal in the pucrunch project was to create a compression system in which
the decompressor would use minimal resources (both memory and processing
power) and still have the best possible compression ratio. A nice bonus
would be if it outperformed every other compression program available.
These understandingly opposite requirements (minimal resources and good
compression ratio) rule out most of the state-of-the-art compression
algorithms and in effect only leave RLE and LZ77 to be considered.
Another goal was to learn something about data compression and that goal
at least has been satisfied.
 <P>
I started by developing a byte-aligned LZ77+RLE compressor/decompressor
and then added a Huffman backend to it. The Huffman tree takes 384 bytes
and the code that decodes the tree into an internal representation takes
100 bytes. I found out that while the Huffman code gained about 8% in my
40-kilobyte test files, the gain was reduced to only about 3% after
accounting the extra code and the Huffman tree.
 <P>
Then I started a more detailed analysis of the LZ77 offset and length values
and the RLE values and concluded that I would get better compression by
using a variable-length code. I used a simple variable-length code and
scratched the Huffman backend code, as it didn't increase the compression
ratio anymore. This version became pucrunch.
 <P>
Pucrunch does not use byte-aligned data, and is a bit slower than the
byte-aligned version because of this, but is much faster than the original
version with the Huffman backend attached. And pucrunch still does very well
compression-wise. In fact, it does very well indeed, beating even LhA,
Zip, and GZip in some cases. But let's not get too much ahead of ourselves.
 <P>
To get an improvement to the compression ratio for LZ77, we have only
some options left. We can improve on the encoding of literal bytes
(bytes that are not compressed), we can reduce the number of literal bytes
we need to encode, and shorten the encoding of RLE and LZ77. In the
algorithm presented here all these improvement areas are addressed
both collectively (one change affects more than one area) and one at a time.
 <P>
<OL>
<LI> By using a variable-length code we can gain compression for even
	2-byte LZ77 matches, which in turn reduces the number of literal
	bytes we need to encode. Most LZ77-variants require 3-byte matches
	to get any compression because they use so many bits to identify
	the length and offset values, thus making the code longer than
	the original bytes would've taken.
 <P>
<LI> By using a new literal byte tagging system which distinguishes
	uncompressed and compressed data efficiently we can reduce number
	of extra bits needed to make this distinction (the encoding
	overhead for literal bytes). This is especially important
	for files that do not compress well.
 <P>
<LI> By using RLE in addition to LZ77 we can shorten the encoding for long
	byte run sequences and at the same time set a convenient upper
	limit to LZ77 match length. The upper limit performs two functions:
	<UL>
	<LI> we only need to encode integers in a specific range
	<LI> we only need to search strings shorter than this limit
	     (if we find a string long enough, we can stop there)
	</UL>
	Short byte runs are compressed either using RLE or LZ77,
	whichever gets the best results.
 <P>
<LI> By doing statistical compression (more frequent symbols
	get shorter representations) on the RLE bytes (in this case
	symbol ranking) we can gain compression for even 2-byte run
	lengths, which in turn reduces the number of literal bytes
	we need to encode.
 <P>
<LI> By carefully selecting which string matches and/or run lengths to use
	we can take advantage of the variable-length code. It may be
	advantageous to compress a string as two shorter matches instead of
	one long match and a bunch of literal bytes, and it can be better
	to compress a string as a literal byte and a long match instead of
	two shorter matches.

<A NAME="C64"></A>
<H2>Commodore 64 Considerations</H2>

Our target environment (Commodore 64) imposes some restrictions which we
have to take into consideration when designing the ideal compression
system. A system with a 1-MHz 3-register 8-bit processor and 64 kilobytes
of memory certainly imposes a great challenge, and thus also a great
sense of achievement for good results.
 <P>
First, we would like it to be able to decompress as big a program as
possible. This in turn requires that the decompression code is located in
low memory (most programs that we want to compress start at address 2049)
and is as short as possible. Also, the decompression code must not use any
extra memory or only very small amounts of it. Extra care must be taken to
make certain that the compressed data is not overwritten during the
decompression before it has been read.
 <P>
Secondly, my number one personal requirement is that the basic end address
must be correctly set by the decompressor so that the program can be
optionally saved in uncompressed form after decompression (although the
current decompression code requires that you say "clr" before saving).
This also requires that the decompression code is system-friendly,
i.e. does not change KERNAL or BASIC variables or other structures.
Also, the decompressor shouldn't rely on file size or load end address
pointers, because these may be corrupted by e.g. X-modem file transfer
protocol (padding bytes may be added).
 <P>
When these requirements are combined, there is not much selection in where
in the memory we can put the decompression code. There are some locations
among the first 256 addresses (zeropage) that can be used, the (currently)
unused part of the processor stack (0x100..0x1ff), the system input buffer
(0x200..0x258) and the tape I/O buffer plus some unused bytes (0x334-0x3ff).
The screen memory (0x400..0x7ff) can also be used if necessary. If we can
do without the screen memory and the tape buffer, we can potentially
decompress files that are located from 0x258 to 0xffff.
 <P>
The third major requirement is that the decompression should be relatively
fast. After 10 seconds the user begins to wonder if the program crashed or
is it doing anything, even if there is some feedback like border color
flashing. This means that the arithmetic used should be mostly 8- or 9-bit
(instead of full 16 bits) and there should be very little of it per each
decompressed byte. Processor- and memory-intensive algorithms like
arithmetic coding and prediction by partial matching (PPM) are pretty much
out of the question, and it is saying it mildly. LZ77 seems the only
practical alternative. Still, run-length encoding handles long byte runs
better than LZ77 and can have a bigger length limit. If we can easily
incorporate RLE and LZ77 into the same algorithm, we should get the best
features from both.
 <P>
A part of the decompressor efficiency depends on the format of the
compressed data. Byte-aligned codes, where everything is aligned into
byte boundaries can be accessed very quickly, non-byte-aligned variable
length codes are much slower to handle, but provide better compression.
Note that byte-aligned codes can still have other data sizes than 8.
For example you can use 4 bits for LZ77 length and 12 bits for LZ77 offset,
which preserves the byte alignment.

<A NAME="Tag"></A>
<H2>The New Tagging System</H2>

I call the different types of information my compression algorithm outputs
<TT>primary units</TT>. The primary units in this compression algorithm are:
<UL>
<LI> literal (uncompressed) bytes and escape sequences,
<LI> LZ77 (length,offset)-pairs,
<LI> RLE (length,byte)-pairs, and
<LI> EOF (end of file marker).
</UL>
Literal bytes are those bytes that could not be represented by shorter codes,
unlike a part of previously seen data (LZ77), or a part of a longer sequence
of the same byte (RLE).
 <P>
Most compression programs handle the selection between compressed data and
literal bytes in a straightforward way by using a prefix bit. If the bit
is 0, the following data is a literal byte (uncompressed). If the bit is 1,
the following data is compressed. However, this presents the problem that
non-compressible data will be expanded from the original 8 bits to 9 bits
per byte, i.e. by 12.5 %. If the data isn't very compressible, this overhead
consumes all the little savings you may have had using LZ77 or RLE.
 <P>
Some other data compression algorithms use a value (using variable-length
code) that indicates the number of literal bytes that follow, but this is
really analogous to a prefix bit, because 1-byte uncompressed data is very
common for modestly compressible files. So, using a prefix bit may seem
like a good idea, but we may be able to do even better. Let's see what
we can come up with. My idea was to somehow use the data itself to mark
compressed and uncompressed data and thus I don't need any prefix bits.
 <P>
Let's assume that 75% of the symbols generated are literal bytes.
In this case it seems viable to allocate shorter codes for literal bytes,
because they are more common than compressed data. This distribution
(75% are literal bytes) suggests that we should use 2 bits to determine
whether the data is compressed or a literal byte. One of the combinations
indicates compressed data, and three of the combinations indicate a literal
byte. At the same time those three values divide the literal bytes into
three distinct groups. But how do we make the connection between which
of the three bit patters we have and what are the literal byte values?
 <P>
The simplest way is to use a direct mapping. We use two bits (let them be
the two most-significant bits) from the literal bytes themselves to
indicate compressed data. This way no actual prefix bits are needed.
We maintain an escape code (which doesn't need to be static), which is
compared to the bits, and if they match, compressed data follows. If the
bits do not match, the rest of the literal byte follows. In this way the
literal bytes do not expand at all if their most significant bits do not
match the escape code, thus less bits are needed to represent the literal
bytes.
 <P>
Whenever those bits in a literal byte would match the escape code, an
escape sequence is generated. Otherwise we could not represent those
literal bytes which actually start like the escape code (the top bits
match). This escape sequence contains the offending data and a new escape
code. This escape sequence looks like <BR>
<PRE>
	# of escape bits    (escape code)
	3                   (escape mode select)
	# of escape bits    (new escape bits)
	8-# of escape bits  (rest of the byte)
	= 8 + 3 + # of escape bits
	= 13 for 2-bit escapes, i.e. expands the literal byte by 5 bits.
</PRE>
Read further to see how we can take advantage of the changing escape code.
 <P>
You may also remember that in the run-length encoding presented in the
previous article two successive equal bytes are used to indicate compressed
data (escape condition) and all other bytes are literal bytes. A similar
technique is used in some C64 packers (RLE) and crunchers (LZ77), the only
difference is that the escape condition is indicated by a fixed byte value.
My tag system is in fact an extension to this. Instead of a full byte, I
use only a few bits.
 <P>
We assumed an even distribution of the values and two escape bits, so 1/4
of the values have the same two most significant bits as the escape code.
I call this probability that a literal byte has to be escaped the
<TT>hit rate</TT>. Thus, literal bytes expand in average 25% of the time by
5 bits, making the average length 25% * 13 + 75% * 8 = 9.25. Not suprising,
this is longer than using one bit to tag the literal bytes. However, there
is one thing we haven't considered yet. The escape sequence has the
possibility to change the escape code. Using this feature to its optimum
(escape optimization), the average 25% <TT>hit rate</TT> becomes the
<STRONG>maximum</STRONG> <TT>hit rate</TT>.
 <P>
Also, because the distribution of the (values of the) literal bytes is
seldom flat (some values are more common than others) and there is locality
(different parts of the file only contain some of the possible values),
from which we can also benefit, the actual hit rate is always much smaller
than that. Empirical studies on some test files show that for 2-bit escape
codes the actual realized hit rate is only 1.8-6.4%, while the theoretical
maximum is the already mentioned 25%.
 <P>
Previously we assumed the distribution of 75% of literal bytes and 25% of
compressed data (other primary units). This prompted us to select 2 escape
bits. For other distributions (differently compressible files, not
necessarily better or worse) some other number of escape bits may be more
suitable. The compressor tries different number of escape bits and select
the value which gives the best overall results. The following table
summarizes the hit rates on the test files for different number of escape
bits.
 <P>

</TABLE>

 <P>
As can be seen from the table, the realized hit rates are dramatically
smaller than the theoretical maximum values. A thought might occur that
we should always select 4-bit (or longer) escapes, because it reduces
the hit rate and presents the minimum overhead for literal bytes.
Unfortunately increasing the number of escape bits also increases the
code length of the compressed data. So, it is a matter of finding the
optimum setting.
 <P>
If there are very few literal bytes compared to other primary units, 1-bit
escape or no escape at all gives very short codes to compressed data,
but causes more literal bytes to be escaped, which means 4 bits extra for
each escaped byte (with 1-bit escapes). If the majority of primary units
are literal bytes, for example a 6-bit escape code causes most of the
literal bytes to be output as 8-bit codes (no expansion), but makes the
other primary units 6 bits longer. Currently the compressor automatically
selects the best number of escape bits, but this can be overriden by
the user with the -e option.
 <P>
The cases in the example with 1-bit escape code validates the original
suggestion: use a prefix bit. A simple prefix bit would produce better
results on three of the previous test files (although only slightly).
For delenn.bin (1 vs 0.828) the escape system works better. On the other
hand, 1-bit escape code is not selected for any of the files, because
2-bit escape gives better overall results.
 <P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> for 7-bit ASCII text files, where the top bit is
always 0 (like most of the Calgary Corpus files), the hit rate is 0% for
even 1-bit escapes. Thus, literal bytes do not expand at all. This is
equivalent to using a prefix bit and 7-bit literals, but does not need
seperate algorithm to detect and handle 7-bit literals.
 <P>
For Calgary Corpus files the number of tag bits per primary unit (counting
the escape sequences and other overhead) ranges from as low as 0.46 (book1)
to 1.07 (geo) and 1.09 (pic). These two files (geo and pic) are the only
ones in the suite where a simple prefix bit would be better than the escape
system. The average is 0.74 tag bits per primary unit.
 <P>
In Canterbury Corpus the tag bits per primary unit ranges from 0.44
(plrabn12.txt) to 1.09 (ptt5), which is the only one above 0.85 (sum).
The average is 0.61 tag bits per primary.
 <P>

<A NAME="Format"></A>
<H2>Primary Units Used for Compression</H2>

The compressor uses the previously described escape-bit system while
generating its output. I call the different groups of bits that are
generated primary units. The primary units in this compression
algorithm are: literal byte (and escape sequence), LZ77
(length,offset)-pair, RLE (length, byte)-pair, and EOF (end of file marker).
 <P>
If the top bits of a literal byte do not match the escape code,
the byte is output as-is. If the bits match, an escape sequence is
generated, with the new escape code. Other primary units start with the
escape code.
 <P>
The Elias Gamma Code is used extensively. This code consists of two
parts: a unary code (a one-bit preceded by zero-bits) and a binary code
part. The first part tells the decoder how many bits are used for the
binary code part. Being a universal code, it produces shorter codes for
small integers and longer codes for larger integers. Because we expect
we need to encode a lot of small integers (there are more short string
matches and shorter equal byte runs than long ones), this reduces the total
number of bits needed. See the previous article for a more in-depth delve
into statistical compression and universal codes. To understand this article,
you only need to keep in mind that small integer value equals short code.
The following discusses the encoding of the primary units.
 <P>
The most frequent compressed data is LZ77. The length of the match is
output in Elias Gamma code, with "0" meaning the length of 2, "100"
length of 3, "101" length of 4 and so on. If the length is not 2,
a LZ77 offset value follows. This offset takes 9 to 22 bits. If the
length is 2, the next bit defines whether this is LZ77 or RLE/Escape.
If the bit is 0, an 8-bit LZ77 offset value follows. (Note that this
restricts the offset for 2-byte matches to 1..256.) If the bit is 1,
the next bit decides between escape (0) and RLE (1).
 <P>
The code for an escape sequence is thus <TT>e..e010n..ne....e</TT>,
where <TT>E</TT> is the byte, and <TT>N</TT> is the new escape code.
Example:
<UL>
<LI> We are using 2-bit escapes
<LI> The current escape code is <TT>"11"</TT>
<LI> We need to encode a byte <TT>0xca == 0b11001010</TT>
<LI> The escape code and the byte high bits match (both are <TT>"11"</TT>)
<LI> We output the current escape code <TT>"11"</TT>
<LI> We output the escaped identification <TT>"010"</TT>
<LI> We output the new escape bits, for example <TT>"10"</TT>
	(depends on escape optimization)
<LI> We output the rest of the escaped byte <TT>"001010"</TT>
<LI> So, we have output the string <TT>"1101010001010"</TT>
</UL>
When the decompressor receives this string of bits, it finds that
the first two bits match with the escape code, it finds the escape
identification (<TT>"010"</TT>) and then gets the new escape, the
rest of the original byte and combines it with the old escape code
to get a whole byte.
 <P>
The end of file condition is encoded to the LZ77 offset and the RLE
is subdivided into long and short versions. Read further, and you get a
better idea about why this kind of encoding is selected.
 <P>
When I studied the distribution of the length values (LZ77 and short
RLE lengths), I noticed that the smaller the value, the more occurrances.
The following table shows an example of length value distribution.

The first column gives a range of values. The first entry has a single
value (2), the second two values (3 and 4), and so on. The second column
shows how many times the different LZ77 match lengths are used, the last
column shows how many times short RLE lengths are used. The distribution
of the values gives a hint of how to most efficiently encode the values.
We can see from the table for example that values 2-4 are used 3455 times,
while values 5-64 are used only 656 times. The more common values need
to get shorter codes, while the less-used ones can be longer.
 <P>
Because in each "magnitude" there are approximately half as many
values than in the preciding one, it almost immediately occurred
to me that the optimal way to encode the length values (decremented
by one) is:
<PRE>
  Value      Encoding       Range     Gained
  0000000    not possible
  0000001    0              1         -6 bits
  000001x    10x            2-3       -4 bits
  00001xx    110xx          4-7       -2 bits
  0001xxx    1110xxx        8-15      +0 bits
  001xxxx    11110xxxx      16-31     +2 bits
  01xxxxx    111110xxxxx    32-63     +4 bits
  1xxxxxx    111111xxxxxx   64-127    +5 bits
</PRE>
The first column gives the binary code of the original value (with
<TT>x</TT> denoting 0 or 1, <TT>xx</TT> 0..3, <TT>xxx</TT> 0..7 and
so on), the second column gives the encoding of the value(s). The
third column lists the original value range in decimal notation.
 <P>
The last column summarises the difference between this code and a
7-bit binary code. Using the previous encoding for the length
distribution presented reduces the number of bits used compared to
a direct binary representation considerably. Later I found out that
this encoding in fact is Elias Gamma Code, only the assignment of 0-
and 1-bits in the prefix is reversed, and in this version the length is
limited. Currently the maximum value is selectable between 64 and 256.
 <P>
So, to recap, this version of the Gamma code can encode numbers from
1 to 255 (1 to 127 in the example). LZ77 and RLE lengths that are used
start from 2, because that is the shortest length that gives us any
compression. These length values are first decremented by one, thus
length 2 becomes <TT>"0"</TT>, and for example length 64 becomes
<TT>"11111011111"</TT>.
 <P>
The distribution of the LZ77 offset values (pointer to a previous
occurrance of a string) is not at all similar to the length distribution.
Admittedly, the distribution isn't exactly flat, but it also isn't as
radical as the length value distribution either. I decided to encode the
lower 8 bits (automatically selected or user-selectable between 8 and
12 bits in the current version) of the offset as-is (i.e. binary code)
and the upper part with my version of the Elias Gamma Code. However,
2-byte matches always have an 8-bit offset value. The reason for this
is discussed shortly.
 <P>
Because the upper part can contain the value 0 (so that we can represent
offsets from 0 to 255 with a 8-bit lower part), and the code can't directly
represent zero, the upper part of the LZ77 offset is incremented by one
before encoding (unlike the length values which are decremented by one).
Also, one code is reserved for an end of file (EOF) symbol. This restricts
the offset value somewhat, but the loss in compression is negligible.
 <P>
With the previous encoding 2-byte LZ77 matches would only gain 4 bits
(with 2-bit escapes) for each offset from 1 to 256, and 2 bits for each
offset from 257 to 768. In the first case 9 bits would be used to represent
the offset (one bit for gamma code representing the high part 0, and
8 bits for the low part of the offset), in the latter case 11 bits are
used, because each "magnitude" of values in the Gamma code consumes two
more bits than the previous one.
 <P>
The first case (offset 1..256) is much more frequent than the second case,
because it saves more bits, and also because the symbol source statistics
(whatever they are) guarantee 2-byte matches in recent history (much better
chance than for 3-byte matches, for example). If we restrict the offset
for a 2-byte LZ77 match to 8 bits (1..256), we don't lose so much
compression at all, but instead we could shorten the code by one bit.
This one bit comes from the fact that before we had to use one bit
to make the selection "8-bit or longer". Because we only have "8-bit"
now, we don't need that select bit anymore.
 <P>
Or, we can use that select bit to a new purpose to select whether this
code really is LZ77 or something else. Compared to the older encoding
(which I'm not detailing here, for clarity's sake. This is already
much too complicated to follow, and only slightly easier to describe)
the codes for escape sequence, RLE and End of File are still the same
length, but the code for LZ77 has been shortened by one bit. Because
LZ77 is the most frequently used primary unit, this presents a saving
that more than compensates for the loss of 2-byte LZ77 matches with offsets
257..768 (which we can no longer represent, because we fixed the offset
for 2-byte matches to use exactly 8 bits).
 <P>
Run length encoding is also a bit revised. I found out that a lot of
bits can be gained by using the same length encoding for RLE as for
LZ77. On the other hand, we still should be able to represent long
repeat counts as that's where RLE is most efficient. I decided to
split RLE into two modes:
<UL>
<LI> short RLE for short (e.g. 2..128) equal byte strings
<LI> long RLE for long equal byte strings
</UL>
The Long RLE selection is encoded into the Short RLE code. Short RLE only
uses half of its coding space, i.e. if the maximum value for the gamma
code is 127, short RLE uses only values 1..63. Larger values switches the
decoder into Long RLE mode and more bits are read to complete the run length
value.
 <P>
For further compression in RLE we rank all the used RLE bytes (the values
that are repeated in RLE) in the decreasing probability order. The values
are put into a table, and only the table indices are output. The indices
are also encoded using a variable length code (the same gamma code,
surprise..), which uses less bits for smaller integer values. As there are
more RLE's with smaller indices, the average code length decreases.
In decompression we simply get the gamma code value and then use the value
as an index into the table to get the value to repeat.
 <P>
Instead of reserving full 256 bytes for the table we only put the top 31 RLE
bytes into the table. Normally this is enough. If there happens to be a byte
run with a value not in the table we use a similar technique as for the
short/long RLE selection. If the table index is larger than 31, it means we
don't have the value in the table. We use the values 32..63 to select the
'escaped' mode and simultaneously send the 5 most significant bits of the
value (there are 32 distinct values in the range 32..63). The rest 3 bits
of the byte are sent separately.
 <P>
If you are more than confused, forget everything I said in this chapter and
look at the decompression pseudo-code later in this article.
 <P>

<A NAME="Graph"></A>
<H2>Graph Search - Selecting Primary Units</H2>

In free-parse methods there are several ways to divide the file into parts,
each of which is equally valid but not necessary equally efficient in terms
of compression ratio.
<PRE>
	"i just saw justin adjusting his sting"

	"i just saw", (-9,4), "in ad", (-9,6), "g his", (-25,2), (-10,4)
	"i just saw", (-9,4), "in ad", (-9,6), "g his ", (-10,5)
</PRE>
The latter two lines show how the sentence could be encoded using literal
bytes and (offset, length) pairs. As you can see, we have two different
encodings for a single string and they are both valid, i.e. they will
produce the same string after decompression. This is what free-parse is:
there are several possible ways to divide the input into parts. If we are
clever, we will of course select the encoding that produces the shortest
compressed version. But how do we find this shortest version? How does
the data compressor decide which primary unit to generate in each step?
 <P>
The most efficient way the file can be divided is determined by a sort
of a graph-search algorithm, which finds the shortest possible route from
the start of the file to the end of the file. Well, actually the algorithm
proceeds from the end of the file to the beginning for efficiency reasons,
but the result is the same anyway: the path that minimizes the bits emitted
is determined and remembered. If the parameters (number of escape bits or
the variable length codes or their parameters) are changed, the graph search
must be re-executed.
 <P>

Think of the string as separate characters. You can jump to the next
character by paying 8 bits to do so (not shown in the figure), unless the
top bits of the character match with the escape code (in which case you need
more bits to send the character "escaped"). If the history buffer contains a
string that matches a string starting at the current character you can jump
over the string by paying as many bits as representing the LZ77
(offset,length)-pair takes (including escape bits), in this example from
11 to 15 bits. And the same applies if you have RLE starting at the character.
Then you just find the least-expensive way to get from the start of the file
to the end and you have found the optimal encoding. In this case the last
characters " sting" would be optimally encoded with
8(literal " ") + 15("sting") = 23 instead of 11(" s") + 13("ting") = 24 bits.
 <P>
The algorithm can be written either cleverly or not-so. We can take a real
short-cut compared to a full-blown graph search because we can/need to only
go forwards in the file: we can simply start from the end! Our accounting
information which is updated when we pass each location in the data consists
of three values:
<OL>
<LI> the minimum bits from this location to the end of file.
<LI> the mode (literal, LZ77 or RLE) to use to get that minimum
<LI> the "jump" length for LZ77 and RLE
</OL>
For each location we try to jump forward (to a location we already processed)
one location, LZ77 match length locations (if a match exists), or RLE
length locations (if equal bytes follow) and select the shortest route,
update the tables accordingly. In addition, if we have a LZ77 or RLE
length of for example 18, we also check jumps 17, 16, 15, ... This gives
a little extra compression. Because we are doing the "tree traverse"
starting from the "leaves", we only need to visit/process each location
once. Nothing located after the current location can't change, so there is
never any need to update a location.
 <P>
To be able to find the minimal path, the algorithm needs the length of
the RLE (the number of the identical bytes following) and the maximum
LZ77 length/offset (an identical string appearing earlier in the file)
for each byte/location in the file. This is the most time-consuming
<STRONG>and</STRONG> memory-consuming part of the compression. I have
used several methods to make the search faster.
See <A HREF="#Match">String Match Speedup</A> later in this article.
Fortunately these searches can be done first, and the actual optimization
can use the cached values.
 <P>
Then what is the rationale behind this optimization? It works because you
are not forced to take every compression opportunity, but select the best
ones. The compression community calls this "lazy coding" or "non-greedy"
selection. You may want to emit a literal byte even if there is a 2-byte
LZ77 match, because in the next position in the file you may have a longer
match. This is actually more complicated than that, but just take my word
for it that there is a difference. Not a very big difference, and only
significant for variable-length code, but it is there and I was after
every last bit of compression, remember.
 <P>
Note that the decision-making between primary units is quite simple if a
fixed-length code is used. A one-step lookahead is enough to guarantee
optimal parsing. If there is a more advantageous match in the next location,
we output a literal byte and that longer match instead of the shorter
match. I don't have time or space here to go very deeply on that, but
the main reason is that in fixed-length code it doesn't matter whether
you represent a part of data as two matches of lengths 2 and 8 or as
matches of lengths 3 and 7 or as any other possible combination (if
matches of those lengths exist). This is not true for a variable-length
code and/or a statistical compression backend. Different match lengths
and offsets no longer generate equal-length codes.
 <P>
Note also that most LZ77 compression algorithms need at least 3-byte
match to break even, i.e. not expanding the data. This is not surprising
when you stop to think about it. To gain something from 2-byte matches
you need to encode the LZ77 match into 15 bits. This is very little.
A generic LZ77 compressor would use one bit to select between a literal
and LZ77, 12 bits for moderate offset, and you have 2 bits left for match
length. I imagine the rationale to exclude 2-byte matches also include
"the potential savings percentage for 2-byte matches is insignificant".
Pucrunch gets around this by using the tag system and Elias Gamma Code,
and does indeed gain bits from even 2-byte matches.
 <P>
After we have decided on what primary units to output, we still have to make
sure we get the best results from the literal tag system. Escape optimization
handles this. In this stage we know which parts of the data are emitted as
literal bytes and we can select the minimal path from the first literal byte
to the last in the same way we optimized the primary units. Literal bytes
that match the escape code generate an escape sequence, thus using more bits
than unescaped literal bytes and we need to minimize these occurrances.
 <P>
For each literal byte there is a corresponding new escape code which
minimizes the path to the end of the file. If the literal byte's high
bits match the current escape code, this new escape code is used next.
The escape optimization routine proceeds from the end of the file to
the beginning like the graph search, but it proceeds linearly and is
thus much faster.
 <P>
I already noted that the new literal byte tagging system exploits the
locality in the literal byte values. If there is no correlation between
the bytes, the tagging system does not do well at all. Most of the time,
however, the system works very well, performing 50% better than the
prefix-bit approach.
 <P>
The escape optimization routine is currently very fast. A little algorithmic
magic removed a lot of code from the original version. Fast escape
optimization routine is quite advantageous, because the number of escape
bits can now vary from 0 (uncompressed bytes always escaped) to 8 and we
need to run the routine again if we change the number of escape bits used
to select the optimal escape code changes.
 <P>
Because escaped literal bytes actually expand the data, we need a safety
area, or otherwise the compressed data may get overwritten by the
decompressed data before we have used it. Some extra bytes need to be
reserved for the end of file marker. The compression routine finds
out how many bytes we need for safety buffer by keeping track of the
difference between input and output sizes while creating the compressed
file.
<PRE>
            $1000 .. $2000
            |OOOOOOOO|           O=original file

        $801 ..
        |D|CCCCC|                C=compressed data (D=decompressor)

 $f7..      $1000     $2010
 |D|            |CCCCC|          Before decompression starts
            ^    ^
            W    R               W=write pointer, R=read pointer
</PRE>
If the original file is located at $1000-$1fff, and the calculated safety
area is 16 bytes, the compressed version will be copied by the decompression
routine higher in memory so that the last byte is at $200f. In this way, the
minimum amount of other memory is overwritten by the decompression. If the
safety area would exceed the top of memory, we need a wrap buffer. This is
handled automatically by the compressor. The read pointer wraps from the end
of memory to the wrap buffer, allowing the original file to extend upto the
end of the memory, all the way to $ffff. You can get the compression program
to tell you which memory areas it uses by specifying the "-s" option.
Normally the safety buffer needed is less than a dozen bytes.
 <P>
To sum things up, Pucrunch operates in several steps:
<OL>
<LI> Find RLE and LZ77 data, pre-select RLE byte table
<LI> Graph search, i.e. which primary units to use
<LI> Primary Units/Literal bytes ratio decides how many escape bits to use
<LI> Escape optimization, which escape codes to use
<LI> Update RLE ranks and the RLE byte table
<LI> Determine the safety area size and output the file.

<HR>
<A NAME="Match"></A>
<H2>String Match Speedup</H2>

To be able to select the most efficient combination of primary units we of
course first need to find out what kind of primary units are available for
selection. If the file doesn't have repeated bytes, we can't use RLE.
If the file doesn't have repeating byte strings, we can't use LZ77.
This string matching is the most time-consuming operation in LZ77
compression simply because of the amount of the comparison operations
needed. Any improvement in the match algorithm can decrease the compression
time considerably. Pucrunch is a living proof on that.
 <P>
The RLE search is straightforward and fast: loop from the current position
(<TT>P</TT>) forwards in the file counting each step until a different-valued
byte is found or the end of the file is reached. This count can then be
used as the RLE byte count (if the graph search decides to use RLE).
The code can also be optimized to initialize counts for all locations that
belonged to the RLE, because by definition there are only one-valued bytes
in each one. Let us mark the current file position by <TT>P</TT>.

<PRE>
    unsigned char *a = indata + P, val = *a++;
    int top = inlen - P;
    int rlelen = 1;

    /* Loop for the whole RLE */
    while (rlelen&lt;top && *a++ == val)
        rlelen++;

    for (i=0; i&lt;rlelen-1; i++)
        rle[P+i] = rlelen-i;
</PRE>
 <P>

With LZ77 we can't use the same technique as for RLE (i.e. using the
information about current match to skip subsequent file locations to
speed up the search). For LZ77 we need to find the longest possible, and
<STRONG>nearest</STRONG> possible, string that matches the bytes
starting from the current location. The nearer the match, the less bits
are needed to represent the offset from the current position.
 <P>
Naively, we could start comparing the strings starting from <TT>P-1</TT>
and <TT>P</TT>, remembering the length of the matching part and then doing
the same at <TT>P-2</TT> and <TT>P</TT>, <TT>P-3</TT> and <TT>P</TT>, ..
<TT>P-j</TT> and <TT>P</TT> (<TT>j</TT> is the maximum search offset).
The longest match and its location (offset from the current position)
are then remembered and initialized. If we find a match longer or equal
than the maximum length we can actually use, we can stop the search
there. (The code used to represent the length values may have an upper
limit.)
 <P>
This may be the first implementation that comes to your (and my) mind,
and might not seem so bad at first. In reality, it is a very slow way
to do the search, the <STRONG>Brute Force</STRONG> method. It could take
somewhere about (<TT>n^3</TT>) byte compares to process a file of the
length <TT>n</TT> (a mathematically inclined person would probably give
a better estimate). However, using the already determined RLE value to
our advantage permits us to rule out the worst-case projection, which
happens when all bytes are the same value. We only search LZ77 matches
if the current file position has shorter RLE sequence than the maximum
LZ77 copy length.
 <P>
The first thing I did to improve the speed is to remember the position
where each byte has last been seen. A simple 256-entry table handles that.
Using this table, the search can directly start from the first potential
match, and we don't need to search for it byte-by-byte anymore. The table
is continually updated when we move toward to the end of the file.
 <P>
That didn't give much of an improvement, but then I increased the table to
256*256 entries, making it possible to locate the latest occurrance of any
byte <STRONG>pair</STRONG> instead. The table indexed with the byte values
and the table contents directly gives the position in file where these two
bytes were last seen. Because the shortest possible string that would offer
any compression (for my encoding of LZ77) is two bytes long, this byte-pair
history is very suitable indeed. Also, the first (shortest possible, i.e.
2-byte) match is found directly from the byte-pair history. This gave a
moderate 30% decrease in compression time for one of my test files (from
28 minutes to 17 minutes on a 25 MHz 68030).
 <P>
The second idea was to quickly discard the strings that had no chance of
being longer matches than the one already found. A one-byte hash value
(sort of a checksum here, it is never used to index a hash table in
this algorithm, but I rather use "hash value" than "checksum") is
calculated from each three bytes of data. The values are calculated once and
put into a table, so we only need two memory fetches to know if two 3-byte
strings are different. If the hash values are different, at least one of the
data bytes differ. If the hash values are equal, we have to compare the
original bytes. The hash values of the strategic positions of the strings to
compare are then .. compared. This strategic position is the location two
bytes earlier than the longest match so far. If the hash values differ, there
is no chance that the match is longer than the current one. It may be not
even be as long, because one of the two earlier bytes may be different. If the
hash values are equal, the brute-force byte-by-byte compare has to be done.
However, the hash value check already discards a huge number of candidates
and more than generously pays back its own memory references. Using the hash
values the compression time shortens by 50% (from 17 minutes to 8 minutes).
 <P>
Okay, the byte-pair table tells us where the latest occurrance of any byte
pair is located. Still, for the latest occurrance before <STRONG>that</STRONG>
one we have to do a brute force search. The next improvement was to use the
byte-pair table to generate a linked list of the byte pairs with the same
value. In fact, this linked list can be trivially represented as a table,
using the same indexing as the file positions. To locate the previous
occurrance of a 2-byte string starting at location P, look at
<TT>backSkip[P]</TT>.
<PRE>
    /* Update the two-byte history & backSkip */
    if (P+1&lt;inlen) {
        int index = (indata[P]&lt;&lt;8) | indata[P+1];
 
        backSkip[P] = lastPair[index];
        lastPair[index] = P+1;
    }
</PRE>
Actually the values in the table are one bigger than the real table
indices. This is because the values are of type unsigned short (can only
represent non-negative values), and I wanted zero to mean "not occurred".
 <P>
This table makes the search of the next (previous) location to consider
much faster, because it is a single table reference. The compression time
was reduced from 6 minutes to 1 minute 10 seconds. Quite an improvement
from the original 28 minutes!
 <P>

In this example we are looking at the string "JOKER" at location <TT>A</TT>.
Using the <TT>lastPair[]</TT> table (with the index "JO", the byte values
at the current location <TT>A</TT>) we can jump directly to the latest match
at <TT>B</TT>, which is "JO", 2 bytes long. The hash values for the string
at <TT>B</TT> ("JOK") and at <TT>A</TT> ("JOK") are compared. Because they
are equal, we have a potential longer match (3 bytes), and the strings
"JOKE.." and "JOKA.." are compared. A match of length 3 is found (the 4th
byte differs). The <TT>backSkip[]</TT> table with the index <TT>B</TT>
gives the previous location where the 2-byte string "JO" can be found,
i.e. <TT>C</TT>. The hash value for the strategic position of the string
in the current position <TT>A</TT> ("OKE") is then compared to the hash
value of the corresponding position in the next potential match starting
at <TT>C</TT> ("OVE"). They don't match, so the string starting at <TT>C</TT>
("JOVE..") can't include a longer match than the current longest match at
<TT>B</TT>.
 <P>
There is also another trick that takes advantage of the already determined
RLE lengths. If the RLE lengths for the positions to compare don't match,
we can directly skip to the next potential match. Note that the RLE bytes
(the data bytes) are the same, and need not be compared, because the first
byte (two bytes) are always equal on both positions (our <TT>backSkip[]</TT>
table guarantees that). The RLE length value can also be used to skip the
start of the strings when comparing them.
 <P>
Another improvement to the search code made it dramatically faster than
before on highly redundant files (such as <TT>pic</TT> from the Calgary
Corpus Suite, which was the Achilles' heel until then). Basically the new
seach method just skips over the RLE part (if any) in the seach position
and then checks if the located position has equal number (and value) of
RLE bytes before it.

          i      p  p+rle[p]-1
</PRE>
The algorithm searches for a two-byte string which starts at
<TT>p + rle[p]-1</TT>, i.e. the last rle byte ('A') and the non-matching
one ('B'). When it finds such location (simple <TT>lastPair[]</TT> or
<TT>backSkip[]</TT> lookup), it checks if the rle in the compare position
(<TT>i-(rle[</TT>p]-1)) is long enough (i.e. the same number of A's before
the B in both places). If there are, the normal hash value check is performed
on the strings and if it succeeds, the brute-force byte-compare is done.
 <P>
The rationale behind this idea is quite simple. There are dramatically less
matches for "AB" than for "AA", so we get a huge speedup with this approach.
We are still guaranteed to find the most recent longest match there is.
 <P>
Note that a compression method similar to RLE can be realized using just
LZ77. You just emit the first byte as a literal byte, and output a LZ77
code with offset 1 and the original RLE length minus 1. You can thus
consider RLE as a special case, which offers tighter encoding of the
necessary information. Also, as my LZ77 limits the copy size to 64/128/256
bytes, a RLE version providing lengths upto 32 kilobytes is a big
improvement, even if the code for it is somewhat longer.

<A NAME="Decompressor"></A>
<H2>The Decompression Routine</H2>

Any lossless compression program is totally useless unless there exists
a decompression program which takes in the compressed file and -- using
only that information -- generates the original file exactly. In this case
the decompression program must run on C64's 6510 microprocessor, which
had its impact on the algorithm development also. Regardless of the
algorithm, there are several requirements that the decompression code
must satisfy:
<OL>
<LI> Correctness - the decompression must behave accurately to guarantee
     lossless decompression
<LI> Memory usage - the less memory is used the better
<LI> Speed - fast decompression is preferred to slower one
</OL>
The latter two requirements can be and are complementary. A somewhat
faster decompression for the same algorithm is possible if more memory
can be used (although in this case the difference is quite small). In
any case the correctness of the result is the most important thing.
 <P>
A short pseudo-code of the decompression algorithm follows before I go to
the actual C64 decompression code.

 <P>
The following routine is the pucrunch decompression code. The code runs on
the C64 or C128's C64-mode and a modified version is used for Vic20 and
C16/Plus4. It can be compiled by at least DASM V2.12.04. Note that the
compressor automatically attaches this code to the packet and sets the
different parameters to match the compressed data. I will insert additional
commentary between strategic code points in addition to the comments that
are already in the code.
 <P>
Note that the version presented here will not be updated when changes are
made to the actual version. This version is only presented to help you to
understand the algorithm.

The first part of the code contains a sys command for the basic interpreter,
two loops that copy the decompression code to zeropage/stack ($f7-$1aa) and
to the system input buffer ($200-$253). The latter code segment contains
byte, bit and Gamma Code input routines and the RLE byte code table, the
former code segment contains the rest.
 <P>
This code also copies the compressed data forward in memory so that it won't
be overwritten by the decompressed data before we have had a change to read
it. The decompression starts at the beginning and proceeds upwards in both
the compressed and decompressed data. A safety area is calculated by the
compression routine. It finds out how many bytes we need for temporary data
expansion, i.e. for escaped bytes. The wrap buffer is used for files that
extend upto the end of memory, and would otherwise overwrite the compressed
data with decompressed data before it has been read.
 <P>
This code fragment is not used during the decompression itself. In fact the
code will normally be overwritten when the actual decompression starts.
 <P>
The very start of the next code block is located inside the zero page and
the rest fills the lowest portion of the microprocessor stack. The zero page
is used to make the references to different variables shorter and faster.
Also, the variables don't take extra code to initialize, because they are
copied with the same copy loop as the rest of the code.

</PRE>
<TT>putch</TT> is the subroutine that is used to output the decompressed
bytes. In this case the bytes are written to memory. Because the subroutine
call itself takes 12 cycles (6 for <TT>jsr</TT> and another 6 for
<TT>rts</TT>), and the routine is called a lot of times during the
decompression, the routine itself should be as fast as possible.
This is achieved by removing the need to save any registers. This is done by
using an absolute addressing mode instead of indirect indexed or absolute
indexed addressing (<TT>sta $aaaa</TT> instead of <TT>sta ($zz),y</TT> or
<TT>sta $aa00,y</TT>). With indexed addressing you would need to
save+clear+restore the index register value in the routine.
 <P>
Further improvement in code size and execution speed is done by storing the
instruction that does the absolute addressing to zero page. When the memory
address is incremented we can use zero-page addressing for it too. On the
other hand, the most time is spent in the bit input routine so further
optimization of this routine is not feasible.

The decompression code is first entered in <TT>main</TT>. It first clears the
accumulator and the Y register and then gets the escape bits (if any are
used) from the input stream. If they don't match with the current escape code,
we get more bits to complete a byte and then output the result. If the escape
bits match, we have to do further checks to see what to do.

</PRE>
We first get the Elias Gamma Code value (or actually my independently
developed version). If it says the LZ77 match length is greater than 2,
it means a LZ77 code and we jump to the proper routine. Remember that the
lengths are decremented before encoding, so the code value 1 means the
length is 2. If the length is two, we get a bit to decide if we have LZ77
or something else. We have to clear the accumulator, because <TT>get1bit</TT>
does not do that automatically.
 <P>
If the bit we got (shifted to carry to clear the accumulator) was zero,
it is LZ77 with an 8-bit offset. If the bit was one, we get another bit
which decides between RLE and an escaped byte. A zero-bit means an escaped
byte and the routine that is called also changes the escape bits to a new
value. A one-bit means either a short or long RLE.

</PRE>
The short RLE only uses half (or actually 1 value less than a half) of the
gamma code range. Larger values switches us into long RLE mode. Because there
are several values, we already know some bits of the length value. Depending
on the gamma code maximum value we need to get from one to three bits more to
assemble a full byte, which is then used as the less significant part for the
run length count. The upper part is encoded using the same gamma code we are
using everywhere. This limits the run length to 16 kilobytes for the smallest
maximum value (<TT>-m5</TT>) and to the full 64 kilobytes for the largest
value (<TT>-m7</TT>).
 <P>
Additional compression for RLE is gained using a table for the 31 top-ranking
RLE bytes. We get an index from the input. If it is from 1 to 31, we use it
to index the table. If the value is larger, the lower 5 bits of the value
gives us the 5 most significant bits of the byte to repeat. In this case we
read 3 additional bits to complete the byte.
<PRE>

	deym
	bne dorle	; Y was 1 bigger than wanted originally

</PRE>
After deciding the repeat count and decoding the value to repeat we
simply have to output the value enough times. The X register holds the
lower part and the Y register holds the upper part of the count.
The X register value is first incremented by one to change the code
sequence <TT>dex ; cpx #$ff ; bne dorle</TT> into simply
<TT>dex ; bne dorle</TT>. This may seem strange, but it saves one
byte in the decompression code and two clock cycles for each byte
that is outputted. It's almost a ten percent improvement. :-)
 <P>
The next code fragment is the LZ77 decode routine and it is used in the
file parts that do not have equal byte runs (and even in some that have).
The routine simply gets an offset value and copies a sequence of bytes
from the already decompressed portion to the current output position.

There are two entry-points to the LZ77 decode routine. The first one

</PRE>
Some kind of a end of file marker is necessary for all variable-length codes.
Otherwise we could not be certain when to stop decoding. Sometimes the byte
count of the original file is used instead, but here a special EOF condition
is more convenient. If the high part of a LZ77 offset is the maximum gamma
code value, we have reached the end of file and must stop decoding. The end
of file code turns on BASIC and KERNEL, turns off 2 MHz mode (for C128) and
updates the basic end addresses before allowing interrupts and jumping to
the program start address.
 <P>
The next code fragment is put into the system input buffer. The routines
are for getting bits from the encoded message (<TT>getbits</TT>) and decoding
the Elias Gamma Code (<TT>getval</TT>). The table at the end contains the
ranked RLE bytes. The compressor automatically decreases the table size if
not all of the values are used.

The original compressor only allows files upto 63 kB. To be able to
compare my algorithm to others I modified the compressor to allow
bigger files. I then got some reference results using the Calgary Corpus
test suite.
 <P>
Note that these results do not include the decompression code (<TT>-c0</TT>).
Instead a 46-byte header is attached and the file can be decompressed with a
standalone decompressor.
 <P>
To tell you the truth, the results surprised me, because the compression
algorithm <STRONG>IS</STRONG> developed for a very special case in mind.
It only has a fixed code for LZ77/RLE lengths, not even a static one
(fixed != static != adaptive)! Also, it does not use arithmetic code
(or Huffman) to compress the literal bytes. Because most of the big
files are ASCII text, this somewhat handicaps my compressor, although
the new tagging system is very happy with 7-bit ASCII input. Also,
decompression is relatively fast, and uses no extra memory.
 <P>
I'm getting relatively near LhA for 4 files, and shorter than LhA for 9 files.
 <P>
The table contains the file name (file), compression options (options)
except <TT>-c0</TT> which specifies standalone decompression,
the original file size (in) and the compressed file size (out) in bytes,
average number of bits used to encode one byte (b/B), remaining size
(ratio) and the reduction (gained), and the time used for compression.
For comparison, the last three columns show the compressed sizes for
LhA, Zip and GZip (with the -9 option), respectively.

<A NAME="Con"></A>
<H2>Conclusions</H2>

In this article I have presented a compression program which creates
compressed executable files for C64, VIC20 and Plus4/C16.  The compression
can be performed on Amiga, MS-DOS/Win machine or any other machine with a
C-compiler.  A powerful machine allows asymmetric compression:  a lot of
resources can be used to compress the data while needing minimal resources
for decompression. This was one of the design requirements.
 <P>
Two original ideas were presented:  a new literal byte tagging system and
an algorithm using hybrid RLE and LZ77.  Also, a detailed explanation of
the LZ77 string match routine and the optimal parsing scheme was presented.
 <P>
The compression ratio and decompression speed is comparable to other
compression programs for Commodore 8-bit computers.
 <P>
But what are then the real advantages of pucrunch compared to traditional
C64 compression programs in addition to that you can now compress VIC20 and
Plus4/C16 programs?  Because I'm lousy at praising my own work, I let you
see some actual user comments.  I have edited the correspondence a little,
but I hope he doesn't mind.  My comments are indented.
 <P>
-------------
 <P>
A big advantage is that pucrunch does RLE and LZ in one pass.  For demos I
only used a cruncher and did my own RLE routines as it is somewhat annoying
to use an external program for this.  These programs require some memory
and ZP-addresses like the cruncher does.  So it can easily happen that the
decruncher or depacker interfere with your demo-part, if you didn't know
what memory is used by the depacker.  At least you have more restrictions
to care about.  With pucrunch you can do RLE and LZ without having too much
of these restrictions.
 <P>
<DL>
<DT>
<DD> Right, and because pucrunch is designed that way from the start, it can
 get better results with one-pass RLE and LZ than doing them separately.
 On the other hand it more or less requires that you _don't_ RLE-pack the
 file first..
</DL>
 <P>
This is true, we also found that out.  We did a part for our demo which had
some tables using only the low-nybble.  Also the bitmap had to be filled
with a specific pattern.  We did some small routines to shorten the part,
but as we tried pucrunch, this became obsolete.  From 59xxx bytes to 12xxx
or 50 blocks, with our own RLE and a different cruncher we got 60 blks!
Not bad at all ;)
 <P>
Not to mention that you have the complete and commented source-code for the
decruncher, so that you can easily change it to your own needs.  And it's
not only very flexible, it is also very powerful.  In general pucrunch does
a better job than ByteBoiler+Sledgehammer.
 <P>
In addition to that pucrunch is of course much faster than crunchers on my
C64, this has not only to do with my 486/66 and the use of an HDD.  See, I
use a cross-assembler-system, and with pucrunch I don't have to transfer
the assembled code to my 64, crunch it, and transfer it back to my pc.
Now, it's just a simple command-line and here we go...  And not only I can
do this, my friend who has an amiga uses pucrunch as well.  This is the
first time we use the same cruncher, since I used to take ByteBoiler, but
my friend didn't have a REU so he had to try another cruncher.
 <P>
So, if I try to make a conclusion:  It's fast, powerful and extremly
flexible (thanks to the source-code).
 <P>
-------------
 <P>
Just for your info...
 <P>
We won the demo-competition at the Interjam'98 and everything that was
crunched ran through the hands of pucrunch...  Of course, you have been
mentioned in the credits.  If you want to take a look, search for
KNOOPS/DREAMS, which should be on the ftp-servers in some time.
So, again, THANKS!  :)
 <P>
       Ninja/DREAMS

 <P>
So, what can I possibly hope to add to that, right?:-)
 <P>
If you have any comments, questions, article suggestions or just a general
hello brewing in your mind, send me mail or visit my homepage.
 <P>
See you all again in the next issue!

Pucrunch expects any number of options and upto two filenames.
If you only give one filename, the compressed file is written to
the stardard output. If you leave out both filenames, the input
is in addition read from the stardard input. Options needing no
value can be grouped together. All values can be given in decimal
(no prefix), octal (prefix 0), or hexadecimal (prefix $ or 0x).
 <P>
Example: <TT>pucrunch demo.prg demo.pck -m6 -fs -p2 -x0xc010</TT>
 <P>
Option descriptions:
<DL>
<DT> c�val�
<DD>	Selects the machine. Possible values are 128(C128), 64(C64),
	20(VIC20), 16(C16/Plus4), 0(standalone). The default is 64, i.e.
	Commodore 64. If you use -c0, a packet without the embedded
	decompression code is produced. This can be decompressed with
	a standalone routine and of course with pucrunch itself.
	The 128-mode is not fully developed yet. Currently it overwrites
	memory locations $f7-$f9 (Text mode lockout, Scrolling, and Bell
	settings) without restoring them later.
 <P>
<DT> a
<DD>	Avoids video matrix if possible. Only affects VIC20 mode.
 <P>
<DT> d
<DD>	Indicates that the file does not have a load address.
	A load address can be specified with <TT>-l</TT> option.
	The default load address if none is specified is 0x258.
 <P>
<DT> l�val�
<DD>	Overrides the file load address or sets it for data files.
 <P>
<DT> x�val�
<DD>	Sets the execution address or overrides automatically detected
	execution address. Pucrunch checks whether a SYS-line is present
	and tries to decode the address. Plain decimal addresses and
	addresses in parenthesis are read correctly, otherwise you need
	to override any incorrect value with this option.
 <P>
<DT> e�val�
<DD>	Fixes the number of escape bits used. You don't usually need
	or want to use this option.
 <P>
<DT> r�val�
<DD>	Sets the LZ77 search range. By specifying 0 you get only RLE.
	You don't usually need or want to use this option.
 <P>
<DT> +f
<DD>	Disables 2MHz mode for C128 and 2X mode in C16/+4.
 <P>
<DT> -fbasic
<DD>	Selects the decompressor for basic programs. This version performs
	the RUN function and enters the basic interpreter automatically.
	Currently only C64 and VIC20 are supported.
 <P>
<DT> -ffast
<DD>	Selects the faster, but longer decompressor version, if such
	version is available for the selected machine and selected options.
	Without this option the medium-speed and medium-size decompressor
	is used.
 <P>
<DT> -fshort
<DD>	Selects the shorter, but slower decompressor version, if such
	version is available for the selected machine and selected options.
	Without this option the medium-speed and medium-size decompressor
	is used.
 <P>
<DT> -fdelta
<DD>	Allows delta matching. In this mode only the waveforms in the data
	matter, any offset is allowed and added in the decompression.
	Note that the decompressor becomes 22 bytes longer if delta matching
	is used and the short decompressor can't be used (24 bytes more).
	This means that delta matching must get more than 46 bytes of total
	gain to get any net savings. So, always compare the result size to a
	version compressed without <TT>-fdelta</TT>.
 <P>
	Also, the compression time increases because delta matching is more
	complicated. The increase is not 256-fold though, somewhere around
	6-7 times is more typical. So, use this option with care and do not
	be surprised if it doesn't help on your files.
 <P>
<DT> n
<DD>	Disables RLE and LZ77 length optimization.
	You don't usually need or want to use this option.
 <P>
<DT> s
<DD>	Display full statistics instead of a compression summary.
 <P>
<DT> p�val�
<DD>	Fixes the number of extra LZ77 position bits used for the low part.
	If pucrunch tells you to to use this option, see if the new
	setting gives better compression.
 <P>
<DT> m�val�
<DD>	Sets the maximum length value. The value should be 5, 6, or 7.
	The lengths are 64, 128 and 256, respectively.
	If pucrunch tells you to to use this option, see if the new
	setting gives better compression. The default value is 7.
 <P>
<DT> i�val�
<DD>	Defines the interrupt enable state to be used after decompression.
	Value 0 disables interrupts, other values enable interrupts.
	The default is to enable interrupts after decompression.
 <P>
<DT> g�val�
<DD>	Defines the memory configuration to be used after decompression.
	Only used for C64 mode (<TT>-c64</TT>). The default value is $37.
 <P>
<DT> u
<DD>	Unpacks/decompresses a file instead of compressing it. The file
	to decompress must have a decompression header compatible with
	one of the decompression headers in the current version.
 <P>
</DL>

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Because pucrunch contains both RLE and LZ77 and they
are specifically designed to work together, <STRONG>DO NOT</STRONG> RLE-pack
your files first, because it will decrease the overall compression ratio.
 <P>

<A NAME="Log"></A>
<H2>The Log Book</H2>

<DL>
<DT> 26.2.1997
<DD>	One byte-pair history buffer gives 30% shorter time
	compared to a single-byte history buffer.
 <P>
<DT> 28.2.1997
<DD>	Calculate hash values (byte) for each threes of
	bytes for faster search, and use the 2-byte history to
	locate the last occurrance of the 2 bytes to get the
	minimal LZ sequence. 50% shorter time.
 <P>
	'Reworded' some of the code to help the compiler generate
	better code, although it still is not quite 'optimal'..
	Progress reports halved.
	Checks the hash value at old maxval before checking the
	actual bytes. 20% shorter time. 77% shorter time total
	(28->6.5).
 <P>
<DT> 1.3.1997
<DD>	Added a table which extends the lastPair functionality.
	The table backSkip chains the positions with the same
	char pairs. 80% shorter time.
 <P>
<DT> 5.3.1997
<DD>	Tried reverse LZ, i.e. mirrored history buffer. Gained
	some bytes, but its not really worth it, i.e. the compress
	time increases hugely and the decompressor gets bigger.
 <P>
<DT> 6.3.1997
<DD>	Tried to have a code to use the last LZ copy position
	(offset added to the lastly used LZ copy position).
	On bs.bin I gained 57 bytes, but in fact the net gain
	was only 2 bytes (decompressor becomes ~25 bytes longer,
	and the lengthening of the long rle codes takes
	away the rest 30).
  <P>
<DT> 10.3.1997
<DD>	Discovered that my representation of integers 1-63 is
	in fact an Elias Gamma Code. Tried Fibonacci code instead,
	but it was much worse (~500 bytes on bs.bin, ~300 bytes on
	delenn.bin) without even counting the expansion of the
	decompression code.
  <P>
<DT> 12.3.1997
<DD>	'huffman' coded RLE byte -&gt; ~70 bytes gain for bs.bin.
	The RLE bytes used are ranked, and top 15 are put into a
	table, which is indexed by a Elias Gamma Code. Other RLE
	bytes get a prefix "1111".
  <P>
<DT> 15.3.1997
<DD>	The number of escape bits used is again selectable.
	Using only one escape bit for delenn.bin gains ~150 bytes.
	If -e-option is not selected, automatically selects the
	number of escape bits (is a bit slow).
 <P> 
<DT> 16.3.1997
<DD>	Changed some arrays to short. 17 x inlen + 64kB memory
	used. opt_escape() only needs two 16-element arrays now
	and is slightly faster.
 <P>
<DT> 31.3.1997
<DD>	Tried to use BASIC ROM as a codebook, but the results
	were not so good. For mostly-graphics files there are no
	long matches -&gt; no net gain, for mostly-code files the
	file itself gives a better codebook.. Not to mention that
	using the BASIC ROM as a codebook is not 100% compatible.
 <P>
<DT> 1.4.1997
<DD>	Tried maxlen 128, but it only gained 17 bytes on ivanova.bin,
	and lost ~15 byte on bs.bin. This also increased the LZPOS
	maximum value from ~16k to ~32k, but it also had little
	effect.
 <P>
<DT> 2.4.1997
<DD>	Changed to coding so that LZ77 has the priority.
	2-byte LZ matches are coded in a special way without
	big loss in efficiency, and codes also RLE/Escape.
 <P>
<DT> 5.4.1997
<DD>	Tried histogram normalization on LZLEN, but it really
	did not gain much of anything, not even counting the mapping
	table from index to value that is needed.
 <P>
<DT> 11.4.1997
<DD>	8..14 bit LZPOS base part. Automatic selection. Some
	more bytes are gained if the proper selection is done
	before the LZ/RLELEN optimization. However, it can't
	really be done automatically before that, because it
	is a recursive process and the original LZ/RLE lengths
	are lost in the first optimization..
 <P>

<DT> 22.4.1997
<DD>	Found a way to speed up the almost pathological
	cases by using the RLE table to skip the matching
	beginnings.
 <P>

<DT> 2.5.1997
<DD>	Switched to maximum length of 128 to get better results
	on the Calgary Corpus test suite.
 <P>

<DT> 25.5.1997
<DD>	Made the maximum length adjustable. -m5, -m6, and -m7
	select 64, 128 and 256 respectively. The decompression
	code now allows escape bits from 0 to 8.
 <P>

<DT> 1.6.1997
<DD>	Optimized the escape optimization routine. It now takes
	almost no time at all. It used a whole lot of time on
	large escape bit values before. The speedup came from
	a couple of generic data structure optimizations and
	loop removals by informal deductions.
 <P>

<DT> 3.6.1997
<DD>	Figured out another, better way to speed up the
	pathological cases. Reduced the run time to a fraction
	of the original time. All 64k files are compressed
	under one minute on my 25 MHz 68030. <TT>pic</TT> from
	the Calgary Corpus Suite is now compressed in 19 seconds
	instead of 7 minutes (200 MHz Pentium w/ FreeBSD). Compression
	of ivanova.bin (one of my problem cases) was reduced from
	about 15 minutes to 47 seconds. The compression of bs.bin
	has been reduced from 28 minutes (the first version) to
	24 seconds. An excellent example of how the changes in
	the algorithm level gives the most impressive speedups.
 <P>

<DT> 6.6.1997
<DD>	Changed the command line switches to use the standard
	approach.
 <P>

<DT> 11.6.1997
<DD>	Now determines the number of bytes needed for temporary
	data expansion (i.e. escaped bytes). Warns if there is not
	enough memory to allow successful decompression on a C64.
 <P>
	Also, now it's possible to decompress the files compressed
	with the program (must be the same version). (-u)
 <P>
<DT> 17.6.1997
<DD>	Only checks the lengths that are power of two's in
	OptimizeLength(), because it does not seem to be any (much)
	worse than checking every length. (Smaller than found maximum
	lengths are checked because they may result in a shorter file.)
	This version (compiled with optimizations on) only spends
	27 seconds on ivanova.bin.
 <P>
<DT> 19.6.1997
<DD>	Removed 4 bytes from the decrunch code (begins to be quite
	tight now unless some features are removed) and simultaneously
	removed a not-yet-occurred hidden bug.
 <P>
<DT> 23.6.1997
<DD>	Checked the theoretical gain from using the lastly outputted
	byte (conditional probabilities) to set the probabilities for
	normal/LZ77/RLE selection. The number of bits needed to code
	the selection is from 0.0 to 1.58, but even using arithmetic
	code to encode it, the original escape system is only 82 bits
	worse (ivanova.bin), 7881/7963 bits total. The former figure is
	calculated from the entropy, the latter includes LZ77/RLE/escape
	select bits and actual escapes.
 <P>
<DT> 18.7.1997
<DD>	In LZ77 match we now check if a longer match (further away)
	really gains more bits. Increase in match length can make
	the code 2 bits longer. Increase in match offset can make
	the code even longer (2 bits for each magnitude). Also, if
	LZPOS low part is longer than 8, the extra bits make the code
	longer if the length becomes longer than two.
 <P>
	ivanova -5 bytes, sheridan -14, delenn -26, bs -29
 <P>
	When generating the output rescans the LZ77 matches.
	This is because the optimization can shorten the matches
	and a shorter match may be found much nearer than the
	original longer match. Because longer offsets usually use
	more bits than shorter ones, we get some bits off for each
	match of this kind. Actually, the rescan should be done
	in OptimizeLength() to get the most out of it, but it is
	too much work right now (and would make the optimize even
	slower).
 <P>
<DT> 29.8.1997
<DD>	4 bytes removed from the decrunch code. I have to thank
	Tim Rogers (timr@eurodltd co uk) for helping with 2 of them.
 <P>
<DT> 12.9.1997
<DD>	Because SuperCPU doesn't work correctly with inc/dec $d030,
	I made the 2 MHz user-selectable and off by default. (-f)
 <P>
<DT> 13.9.1997
<DD>	Today I found out that most of my fast string matching algorithm
	matches the one developed by [Fenwick and Gutmann, 1994]*.
	It's quite frustrating to see that you are not a genius
	after all and someone else has had the same idea. :-)
	However, using the RLE table to help still seems to be an
	original idea, which helps immensely on the worst cases.
	I still haven't read their paper on this, so I'll just
	have to get it and see..
 <P>
	* [Fenwick and Gutmann, 1994]. P.M. Fenwick and P.C. Gutmann,
	"Fast LZ77 String Matching", Dept of Computer Science,
	The University of Auckland, Tech Report 102, Sep 1994
 <P>
<DT> 14.9.1997
<DD>	The new decompression code can decompress files from
	$258 to $ffff (or actually all the way upto $1002d :-).
	The drawback is: the decompression code became 17 bytes
	longer. However, the old decompression code is used if
	the wrap option is not needed.
 <P>
<DT> 16.9.1997
<DD>	The backSkip table can now be fixed size (64 kWord) instead of
	growing enormous for "BIG" files. Unfortunately, if the fixed-size
	table is used, the LZ77 rescan is impractical (well, just a little
	slow, as we would need to recreate the backSkip table again).
	On the other hand the rescan did not gain so many bytes in the
	first place (percentage). The define BACKSKIP_FULL enables
	the old behavior (default). Note also, that for smaller files
	than 64kB (the primary target files) the default consumes less
	memory.
 <P>
	The hash value compare that is used to discard impossible matches
	does not help much. Although it halves the number of strings to
	consider (compared to a direct one-byte compare), speedwise the
	difference is negligible. I suppose a mismatch is found very
	quickly when the strings are compared starting from the third
	charater (the two first characters are equal, because we have
	a full hash table). According to one test file, on average
	3.8 byte-compares are done for each potential match. A define
	HASH_COMPARE enables (default) the hash version of the compare,
	in which case "inlen" bytes more memory is used.
 <P>
	After removing the hash compare my algorithm quite closely
	follows the [Fenwick and Gutmann, 1994] fast string matching
	algorithm (except the RLE trick). (Although I *still* haven't
	read it.)
 <P>
	14 x inlen + 256 kB of memory is used (with no HASH_COMPARE
	and without BACKSKIP_FULL).
 <P>
<DT> 18.9.1997
<DD>	One byte removed from the decompression code (both versions).
 <P>
<DT> 30.12.1997
<DD>	Only records longer matches if they compress better than
	shorter ones. I.e. a match of length N at offset L can be
	better than a match of length N+1 at 4*L. The old comparison
	was "better or equal" ("&gt;="). The new comparison "better" ("&gt;")
	gives better results on all Calgary Corpus files except "geo",
	which loses 101 bytes (0.14% of the compressed size).
 <P>
	An extra check/rescan for 2-byte matches in OptimizeLength()
	increased the compression ratio for "geo" considerably, back
	to the original and better. It seems to help for the other
	files also. Unfortunately this only works with the full
	backskip table (BACKSKIP_FULL defined).
 <P>
<DT> 21.2.1998
<DD>	Compression/Decompression for VIC20 and C16/+4 incorporated
	into the same program.
 <P>
<DT> 16.3.1998
<DD>	Removed two bytes from the decompression codes.
 <P>
<DT> 17.8.1998
<DD>    There was a small bug in pucrunch which caused the location
        $2c30 to be incremented (inc $2c30 instead of bit $d030) when
	run without the -f option. The source is fixed and executables
	are now updated.
 <P>
<DT> 21.10.1998
<DD>	Added interrupt state (<TT>-i�val�</TT>) and memory
	configuration (<TT>-g�val�</TT>) settings. These settings
	define which memory configuration is used and whether
	interrupts will be enabled or disabled after decompression.
	The executables have been recompiled.
 <P>
<DT> 13.2.1999
<DD>	Verified the standalone decompressor. With -c0 you can
	now generate a packet without the attached decompressor.
	The decompressor allows the data anywhere in memory provided
	the decompressed data doesn't overwrite it.
 <P>
<DT> 25.8.1999
<DD>	Automatised the decompressor relocation information generation and
	merged all decompressor versions into the same <TT>uncrunch.asm</TT>
	file. All C64, VIC20 and C16/+4 decompressor variations are now
	generated from this file. In addition to the default version, a fast
	but longer, and a short but slower decompressor is provided for C64.
	You can select these with <TT>-ffast</TT> and <TT>-fshort</TT>,
	respectively. VIC20 and C16/+4 now also have a non-wrap versions.
	These save 24 bytes compared to the wrap versions.
 <P>
<DT> 3.12.1999
<DD>	Delta LZ77 matching was added to help some weird demo parts
	on the suggestion of Wanja Gayk (Brix/Plush). In this mode
	(<TT>-fdelta</TT>) the DC offset in the data is discarded
	when making matches: only the 'waveform' must be identical.
	The offset is restored when decompressing. As a bonus this
	match mode can generate descending and ascending strings with
	any step size. Sounds great, but there are some problems:
	<UL>
	<LI> these matches are relatively rare --
		usually basic LZ77 can match the same strings
	<LI> the code for these matches is quite long (at least currently) --
		4-byte matches are needed to gain anything
	<LI> the decompressor becomes 22 bytes longer if delta matching is
		used and the short decompressor version can't be used
		(24 bytes more). This means that delta matching must get
		more than 46 bytes of total gain to get any net savings.
	<LI> the compression time increases because matching is more
		complicated -- not 256-fold though, somewhere around 6-7
		times is more typical
	<LI> more memory is also used -- 4*insize bytes extra
	</UL>
	However, if no delta matches get used for a file, pucrunch falls
	back to non-delta decompressor, thus reducing the size of the
	decompressor automatically by 22 (normal mode) or 46 bytes
	(<TT>-fshort</TT>).
 <P>
	I also updated the C64 test file figures. <TT>-fshort</TT> of course
	shortened the files by 24 bytes and <TT>-fdelta</TT> helped on
	bs.bin. Beating RLE+ByteBoiler by amazing 350 bytes feels absolutely
	great!
 <P>
<DT> 4.12.1999
<DD>	See 17.8.1998. This time "dec $d02c" was executed instead of
	"bit $d030" after decompression, if run without the <TT>-f</TT>
	option. Being sprite#5 color register, this bug has gone unnoticed
	since 25.8.1999.
 <P>
<DT> 7.12.1999
<DD>	Added a short version of the VIC20 decompressor. Removed a byte from
	the decrunch code, only the "-ffast" version remained the same size.
 <P>

<DT> 14.12.1999
<DD>	Added minimal C128 support. $f7-$f9 (Text mode lockout, Scrolling,
	and Bell settings) are overwritten and not reinitialized.
 <P>

<DT> 30.1.2000
<DD>	For some reason -fshort doesn't seem to work with VIC20. I'll have to
	look into it. It looks like a jsr in the decompression code partly
	overwrites the RLE byte code table. The decompressor needs 5 bytes of
	stack. The stack pointer it now set to $ff at startup for non-C64
	short decompressor versions, so you can't just change the final jmp
	into rts to get a decompressed version of a program.
 <P>
	Also, the "-f" operation for C16/+4 was changed to blank the screen
	instead of using the "freeze" bit.
 <P>
	2MHz or other speedups are now automatically selected. You can turn
	these off with the "+f" option.
 <P>

<DT> 8.3.2002
<DD>	The wrong code was used for EOF and with -fdelta the EOF code
	and the shortest DELTA LZ length code overlapped, thus decompression
	ended prematurely.
  <P>

<DT> 24.3.2004
<DD>	-fbasic added to allow compressing BASIC programs with ease.
	Calls BASIC run entrypoint ($a871 with Z=1), then BASIC Warm Start
	($a7ae). Currently only VIC20 and C64 decompressors are available.
  What are the corresponding entrypoints for C16/+4 and C128?
 <P>
	Some minor tweaks. Reduced the RLE byte code table to 15 entries.
 <P>

<DT> 21.12.2005
<DD> Pucrunch is now under GNU LGPL. And the decompression code is distributed
     under the WXWindows Library Licence.
    (In short: binary version of the decompression code can
     accompany the compressed data or used in decompression programs.)
 <P>

<DT> 28.12.2007
<DD>   Ported the development directory to FreeBSD. Noticed that the -fbasic
  version has not been released. -flist option added.
  <P>
<DT> 13.1.2008
<DD>   Added -fbasic support for C128.
  <P>
<DT> 18.1.2008
<DD>   Added -fbasic support for C16/+4.
  <P>
<DT> 22.11.2008
<DD>   Fix for sys line detection routine. Thanks for Zed Yago.
